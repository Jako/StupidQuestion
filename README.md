# StupidQuestion

StupidQuestion is a simple but effective and userfriendly captcha solution for
FormIt in MODx Revolution. A stupid question (i.e. 'What is the given name of
Albert Einstein?') is inserted in the form template. The form field is filled
and hidden by a javascript that is packed by a javascript packer. The packer
scrambles the code and because of the input name contains different counts of
hyphens the right answer is not placed at the same position. The filling bots
have to execute javascript - a lot don't do that.
